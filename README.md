# _EnglishThesaurus

The program let's the user enter any English word and gives a definition of it. 
The word definitions are stored in a json file called data.json. The code converts the json file to a dictionary data type. Thus the user 
inputs a key and the program outputs the value.

This program accounts for:
- case sensitivity (e.g. France, france, FraNce, FRANCE, etc.)
- typos (e.g. appleee, rainn)
- words that don't exist in the dictionary
